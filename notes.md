# JavaScript

## 5 Primitive Datatypes

1. Numbers.
2. Strings.
3. Booleans.
4. Null.
5. Undefined.

## Counting

`.length` will count the characters in a string starting with `1`. But the `index` will start counting from `0`, so `index` will always be one value less than `length`.

## Variable Cases

- camelCase (this is what you should use for variables in JavaScript)
- snake_case
- kebob-case (or dash-case)
